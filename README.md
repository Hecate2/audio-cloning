# GAN for Audio Style Transfer 
Utilized AC-GAN to train on short wav signal. 

The goal is to obtain Person A's voice and transfer it to Person B's voice. Person A will sound like, and speak like Person B. (voice pitch and cadence) 

This requires use of Mel-spectrogram and then perform some training on Generative Network to transform the data.
